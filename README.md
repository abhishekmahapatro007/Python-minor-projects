# Python Minor Projects

This repository contains three fun and simple Python projects that use the Turtle graphics library. The projects demonstrate various aspects of programming including animation, interaction, and basic game mechanics.

## Projects

### 1. Flappy Bird (Using Turtle Graphics)
This is a simple implementation of the classic "Flappy Bird" game, where a bird is controlled by tapping on the screen to avoid obstacles (balls). The player taps to move the bird upwards while trying to avoid hitting the falling balls.

#### Features:
- Tap the screen to make the bird fly upward.
- Avoid obstacles (balls) as they move toward the bird.
- The bird falls due to gravity if not tapped.
- The game ends when the bird collides with an obstacle or goes off-screen.

#### How to Play:
- Click on the game window to make the bird jump.
- Avoid hitting the black balls that move across the screen.

### 2. Pong (Multiplayer)
This is a simple two-player Pong game. It includes two paddles that players control and a ball that bounces around the screen. The objective is to keep the ball in play while trying to score points by getting the ball past the opponentâ€™s paddle.

#### Features:
- Two paddles that can be controlled using keyboard keys.
  - Player 1: Use `W` to move up, `S` to move down.
  - Player 2: Use `I` to move up, `K` to move down.
- The ball bounces off the walls and paddles.
- The game ends when the ball passes one of the paddles.

#### How to Play:
- Player 1 uses `W` and `S` to control their paddle.
- Player 2 uses `I` and `K` to control their paddle.
- The first player to score wins the game (the ball passes the opponent's paddle).

### 3. Animation (Using Turtle)
This project demonstrates simple animation using the Turtle graphics library. The exact animation details are unspecified, but it likely showcases the power of Turtle's drawing capabilities to create interactive and dynamic animations.

#### Features:
- Simple Turtle graphics animations.
- Can be extended for more complex animations or visualizations.

#### How to Play:
- Run the script to view the animation.

## Installation

To run these projects, you will need to have Python installed on your machine along with the `turtle` and `freegames` modules. If you don't have them installed, you can install them using the following commands:

1. Install Python (if you haven't already) from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install the required modules by running:

```bash
pip install freegames
